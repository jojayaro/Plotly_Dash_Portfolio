# Portfolio built on Plotly Dash (Currently offline)

This is the code for my portfolio built in Plotly Dash. I have always had a passion for computer science and only until recently I made the move into IT. Most of my career has been focused on data analysis so I started by exploring the Developer and Data Engineering world. I decided to use Plotly Dash since I consider it the best open source front-end framework for data professionals. In trying to understand the overall picture in development, I tried to develop a full-stack solution, which included installing a server, deploying a single node Kubernetes cluster, a database, and the webapp. There is still a lot to learn but it helped me understand how everything works together.

The portfolio has data projects around my hobbies and interests, such as the Aurora Borealis, Energy, among others. Data is presented in different intervals, from real-time to daily refreshes, depending on the project. One of these projects is based on one of my [repos](https://github.com/jojayaro/Exploration_App) which is a parser that converts text files to CSVs and uploads them to a database daily. This repo is currently being refactored to Rust as part of my learning process, and possible migration of this project completely to Rust.

I stopped hosting the portfolio because Iâ€™m exploring moving everything to Rust and it was taxing my bandwidth unnecessarily, sometimes consuming up to a 1TB/Month in bandwidth.
